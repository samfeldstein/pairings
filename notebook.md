# Notebook

## To do

### Accessiblity

- Keyboard
- Voiceover

### Style

- Make list names bigger in all lists
- Colorful buttons
- Add space between create list items

## Issues

- When you add an item to a saved list, the list doesn't sort automatically. It also doesn't add a delete button.
  - This doesn't seem like a huge deal, so I'm leaving it alone for now.
