# Notebook

## To do

- On load, show just the three buttons to enter each section. That way the screen isn't crowded by anything that's not relevant.
- Style credits
- Help section/readme
- Fonts
  - Font files
  - Fallback
- Preload fonts
- Increase section padding
- Select borders

### Accessiblity

- Keyboard
- Voiceover

### Style

- Make list names bigger in all lists
- Colorful buttons
- Add space between create list items

## Issues

- When you add an item to a saved list, the list doesn't sort automatically. It also doesn't add a delete button.
  - This doesn't seem like a huge deal, so I'm leaving it alone for now.
