## Roadmap

- Delete lists
- Edit lists (delete and add items)
- Sort lists
- Select lists to pair

## Fix

- Only render save button if the list is not empty. Or disable it at least.

## Refactor

- Use one event listener for multiple events?
- Make input a component? Use case seems to fit. Element used multiple times that needs special treatment.
- Make list items a component?

## Wishlist

- Lock lists in place so you don't have to select them every time you open the app.
