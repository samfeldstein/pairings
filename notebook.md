## To do

- Accessibility
  - Keyboard
  - Voiceover
- Use type="button" to disable default behavior where you can
- Replace class hidden with hidden attr
- Generator reset behavior should just occur when you hit the generate button
- Make list names bigger in all lists 
- Allow change of saved list names
- Colorful buttons
- Add space between create list items

## Issues

- When you add an item to a saved list, the list doesn't sort automatically. It also doesn't add a delete button.
  - This doesn't seem like a huge deal, so I'm leaving it alone for now.

## Refactor

- Use one event listener for multiple events?
- Make input a component? Use case seems to fit. Element used multiple times that needs special treatment.
- Make list items a component?

## Wishlist

- Lock lists in place so you don't have to select them every time you open the app.
