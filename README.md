# Pairings

I had a friend who taught religion at a Catholic school and needed a way to pair her students with a random saint for a project. She hadn't yet found a tool for the job, so I decided to build one for her.

The app generates random pairings from any two lists. It's pretty straightforward. But this is my first JavaScript application, so if anything seems confusing or broken, please email me at [sam@samfeldstein.xyz](mailto:sam@samfeldstein.xyz).

The app is a partial PWA, so you can put it on your phone or desktop. Desktop requires a Chromium browser. Instructions for that are on the [Pairings website](https://pairingapp.netlify.app/about).

The app employs a service worker so you can use it offline, but I am slightly less than 100% sure that this works properly. Please report any wonkiness.
