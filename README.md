# Pairings

I had a friend who taught religion at a Catholic school and needed a way to pair her students with a random saint for a project. She hadn't yet found a tool for the job, so I decided to build one for her.

Built with semantic html, modern css, and vanilla javascript. It's a partial PWA, so you can download to your phone or desktop. Desktop requires a Chromium browser. Instructions for that are on the [Pairings website](https://pairingapp.netlify.app/about).

You can read more about this project in [my notes on the subject](https://notebook.samfeldstein.xyz/notes/pairings-notes/).
