# README

I made this app for a teacher friend of mine who was teaching at a Catholic school and needed a way to pair her students with a random saint so they could do a report on them.

In the final version of the app, you will be able to create your own lists and generate pairings with any other list.

Some potential use cases:

- Pair students with a random subject. Good for assigning projects.
- Pair students with each other. Good for group projects.

## Roadmap

- Make your own lists
  - Enter a list name.
  - Add items.
  - The list will be sorted alphabetically, according the first list selected.
- Pair any list with any other list
- Add generation animation. Since this is for students, the more fun the better.
- Replace text field with delete buttons.
- If the number entered is greater than the number of array elements, allow duplicates
- Reset create list button on unfocus
- Edit lists
