I had a friend who taught religion at a Catholic school and needed a way to pair her students with a random saint for a project. She hadn't yet found a tool for the job, so I decided to  build one for her.

What the app does is generate random pairings from any two lists. It's pretty straightforward. But this is my first JavaScript application, so if anything seems confusing or broken, please email me at [sam@samfeldstein.xyz](mailto:sam@samfeldstein.xyz).
