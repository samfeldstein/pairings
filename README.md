I had a friend who taught religion at a Catholic school and needed a way to pair her students with a random saint for a project. She hadn't yet found a tool for the job, so I decided to build one for her.

The app generates random pairings from any two lists. It's pretty straightforward. But this is my first JavaScript application, so if anything seems confusing or broken, please email me at [sam@samfeldstein.xyz](mailto:sam@samfeldstein.xyz).
